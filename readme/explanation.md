## Component Selection & Implementation

I chose to recreate an Airbnb hero component after browsing through companies known for their strong design, like Stripe and Airbnb. When I landed on this particular page, I instantly knew this was it. The component had everything I was looking for: a bold title, nice typography variations, and manageable interactivity that I could recreate well within the timeframe. First step was checking out the HTML and CSS to see how it was built, came to the conclusion that it was quite messy to look into, but it's easy to extract the values and colors. Total time was around 8 hours spread over 3 evenings, including scouting, setting up a Vite environment, and building the component.

I set up a React + Tailwind project, configured proper prettier/eslint/typescript rules, then worked through colors, fonts, JSX structure, accessibility and component splitting. I handled all the typography and spacing first, then the layout, and finally hooked up the slider logic with state management. What I'm most proud of is the slider functionality. I really enjoy building interactive elements that work together smoothly, even something small like this. Initially, I wanted to create the slider by hand, but due to time constraints, the Radix slider gave me exactly what I wanted with proper accessibility. Since I'm working on a 14-inch laptop at home, I couldn't put them side by side easily to see if the designs are matching, so I constantly tabbed between the original and my version to check for inconsistencies for each breakpoint. Since I picked the values carefully from the regular page, it was easy to make it look identical. Even though this was more of a prototype project, I approached it with a "real project" mindset by separating concerns and making everything as modular as possible. If I had more time, I would've created the animation of the numbers by hand and added markers to the map to make it more complete, and maybe called an API to drop markers on the map for a nice async touch. 

But I'm proud and happy of the thing I've made, and it was fun.
